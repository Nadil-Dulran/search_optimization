# student_bfs.py
# ============================================================
# TASK
#   Implement Breadth-First Search that returns a SHORTEST path
#   (by number of steps) from start to goal on an UNWEIGHTED grid.
#
# SIGNATURE (do not change):
#   bfs(start, goal, neighbors_fn, trace) -> List[Coord]
#
# PARAMETERS
#   start: (r, c)      tuple for start cell
#   goal:  (r, c)      tuple for goal cell
#   neighbors_fn(u):   function returning valid 4-neighbors of u
#   trace:             object with method trace.expand(node)
#                      YOU MUST call trace.expand(u) each time you
#                      pop/remove u from the FRONTIER to expand it.
#
# RETURN
#   A list of coordinates [(r0,c0), (r1,c1), ..., goal].
#   If no path is found, return [].
#
# NOTES
# - Use a QUEUE (FIFO).
# - Keep a parent map: parent[child] = node we came from.
# - Reconstruct path when you first reach goal.
# - You may print debug info; the runner will still grade correctly.
